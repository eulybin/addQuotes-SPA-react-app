# addQuotes-SPA-react-app
In this app, we build a SPA with React Router v5. It is a Quotes App where the user is able to add New Quotes, leave comments on those quotes, view all the quotes and sort them in Ascending/Descending order. We also make use of Firebase to send Http Requests and store the quotes data.
